------------------------------------------- LangChain ----------------------------------------

Suppose you have multiple AI models or LLM's like :- Open AI, Gemini, Claude, Deepseek etc and every LLM has different API response payload.

So basically the LangChain will unify all of the AI models API Calling i.e. LangChain(AI API Calling).


Example :- 
Suppose we have a PDF file in which there is a 1 Lac Characters and this file has to be given to the Open AI model.
LangChain Community Packages like PDFLoader which will read the PDF file in the form of chunks for you. 

-- LangChain will simply for you like providing the pre-built packages.


------------------------------------------- LangGraph ----------------------------------------

- LangGraph will basically work as a Graph Orchestration(Management) tool like how you can control the flow of prompt and on the basis of prompt which particular function operations has to be performed.

- Offical statement :- LangChain is a stateful, orchestration framework that brings added control to agent workflows.


------------------------------------------- LangSmith ----------------------------------------

- LangSmith basically works as a OpenTelemetry tool's in which you can check or monitoring the application performance, application logging on particular events, application health check etc.

- So when we are working with AI agentic application workflows then the LangSmith comes into play as a application tracing.
